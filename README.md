# GTMStack Hero Tile

## 🧠 Context & Creative Strategy
This project features a high-fidelity, animated 600x600 hero tile designed for GTMStack, a consulting brand. The animation visualizes a three-phase journey: "Chaos" (scattered elements), "Routes" (connecting pathways representing integration), and "Stack" (an organized, vertically aligned technology stack). It serves as a visual metaphor for turning operational complexity into clarity and alignment.

## 🎯 Purpose & Value Proposition
The primary goal of this component is to communicate GTMStack's core value proposition: bringing order to the typically fragmented world of go-to-market operations. By using motion, we demonstrate the transition from individual tool silos to a unified, high-performance architecture.

## 🚀 Ideal Use Cases
- **B2B Consulting Hero Sections**: Perfectly sized for square landing page slots.
- **Strategy Pitch Decks**: Can be used as a looping background for "Our Process" slides.
- **RevOps Dashboards**: Serves as an aesthetic onboarding or status visualization.

## 👤 Target Audience
- **RevOps Professionals**: Those looking for streamlined tool integration.
- **B2B Founders**: Seeking to align their sales, marketing, and success stacks.
- **Consultants**: Professional services firms needing high-end visual assets for their GTM methodology.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The design follows a "Premium Dark" aesthetic, utilizing a `slate-950` foundation to allow the vibrant module gradients to pop. The use of glassmorphism (glossy overlays) and thin stroke lines creates a technical, precise feel characteristic of high-end data platforms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React 19**: Core UI library.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and structured data interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: Handles complex SVG paths, layout transitions (Magic Motion), and sequence timing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development and consistent design tokens.
- **Lucide React**: Vector icons used for the distinct technology modules.

## ⚙️ Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`.
2. **Running**: Start the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
3. **Integration**: Import `<GTMStackHero />` into any React container with at least 600px of space.
